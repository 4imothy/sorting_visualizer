### Sorting visualizer built with React, it is hosted [here](https://4tlc.github.io/sorting_visualizer)

The sorter works by having an array which stores numerical values and another array which stores the columns in the document. When a sorting algorithm is called, the value array gets sorted and as that happens the swapped values are being mapped to height swaps of the columns. After each comparison, swapping or placement of a column there is a delay created with setTimeout() so that the sorting can actually be visualized and doesn't happen in real time (which would be too fast to see).

For the in-place algorithms, when I swapped a value in the value array I would then grab the two columns that are in the same index, change their color and then swap their heights. Mapping the in-place algorithms did not pose many challenges. Merge-Sort on the other hand, which utilizes another array of the same size was difficult. For this I created another array to store every action in the sort. At every comparison, swap or placement I would append the index, and either the column to swap or the new height to assign it. Then after the sorting of the value array is done I would read through that array and map the actions appropriately.
